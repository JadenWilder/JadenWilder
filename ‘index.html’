    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Jaden Wilder. I am an 18-year-old freshman at Newberry College, majoring in Computer Science with a path leading to software development. I enjoy gaming, listening to music, and drawing occasionally.</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p>My hobbies consist of gaming, listening to music, and drawing sometimes. Music to me is a relaxer and even motivation. There is a song for every way I feel. Gaming is the hobby I do the most. It's a way for me to take my mind off of work or even problems. Whether Iâ€™m exploring new worlds, competing with friends, or just enjoying a great story, gaming helps me relax and have fun.</p>
